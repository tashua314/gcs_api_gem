# GcsApiGem

This project is a Ruby lib for Google's Custom Search Engine API (http://www.google.com/cse).
This is very easy to use but available functions are restricted.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/gcs_api_gem`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gcs_api_gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gcs_api_gem

### Configure

You need to configure KEY and CSE_ID to environment variables.

    $ export KEY=<GOOGLE_API_KEY>
    $ export SCE_ID=<GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID>

Or write to .bashrc as below:

```.bashrc
export KEY=<GOOGLE_API_KEY>
export SCE_ID=<GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID>
```

And then execute:

    $ source ~/.bashrc

### Remarks

If you want to know how to get GOOGLE_CUSTOME_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID and GOOGLE_API_KEY, look at [here](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview).
Or see [here](http://ryutamaki.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/01/18/171640).

## Usage

```

Then you get a random image searched by keyword.

    :search_result=>"320000000",
    :start_index=>2
   }
```
